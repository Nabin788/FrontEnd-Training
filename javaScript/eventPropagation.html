<!-- !  Event Propagation. Event capturing and Event Bubbling -->
<!-- ? 1. Event Capturing:  -->
<!-- * Also known as event trickling, this is the opposite of bubbling. 
 *     The event starts from the root and trickles down to the target element. 
 *     Capturing is less commonly used compared to bubbling. -->

<!-- * Use in Delegation: Event capturing is typically not used in event delegation
*      because it handles events in the reverse order, making it less intuitive for the typical use cases of event delegation.-->

<!-- ? 2. Event Bubbling: -->
<!-- * Event Bubbling: When an event is triggered on an element,
*      it first runs the handlers on that element, then on its parent,
*      then all the way up the DOM tree until it reaches the document root. This is known as event bubbling. -->

<!-- * Default Behavior: Event delegation leverages this default behavior
 *     to manage events for multiple child elements by attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor. -->

<!-- ? Event delegation -->
<!-- * Add a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for its child elements. -->
